# CS601C Computational Statistics Midterm Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains my **CS601C Computational Statistics Midterm Project** at **Pace University**. The project focuses on analyzing three datasets: **College, Auto, and Boston Housing** using **R and RMarkdown**. It involves **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, regression modeling, and statistical interpretation** to extract meaningful insights.

## Repository Contents

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `cs160.Rmd` | RMarkdown file containing the full data analysis and statistical modeling. |
| `cs160.html` | Knitted HTML report for easy visualization of results. |
| `College.csv` | Dataset containing information about different colleges. |
| `Auto.csv` | Dataset on automobile attributes and fuel efficiency. |
| `Boston.csv` | Dataset analyzing housing values and crime rates in Boston suburbs. |
| `Spring 2025 Midterm Project.pdf` | Project guidelines provided by the professor. |

## Technologies Used
- R Programming
- RMarkdown
- ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Linear and Multiple Regression Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Key Insights
### College Dataset
- Private colleges generally have higher out-of-state tuition fees.
- Institutions with a high percentage of top 10% students tend to be more expensive.
- Graduation rates correlate positively with instructional expenditure.

### Auto Dataset
- Vehicles with higher **horsepower** and **weight** tend to have lower fuel efficiency (mpg).
- Newer model years show improved fuel economy.
- Regression analysis identifies key predictors of fuel efficiency.

### Boston Housing Dataset
- Crime rates show a correlation with tax rates and socioeconomic factors.
- Housing values are influenced by accessibility to highways and pupil-teacher ratios.
- Proximity to the Charles River does not significantly impact crime rates.

## How to Run the Project
### Option 1: View the HTML Report
- Open `cs160.html` in any web browser to view the analysis.

### Option 2: Run the RMarkdown File
1. Download all files from the repository.
2. Open `cs160.Rmd` in **RStudio**.
3. Install required libraries if missing:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "corrplot", "MASS"))
   ```
4. Click **Knit** to generate an HTML report.
